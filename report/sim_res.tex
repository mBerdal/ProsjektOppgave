\section{Simulations}\label[sec]{results}
Simulations are done in four different mission spaces with properties summed up in Table \ref{tab:worlds}.
\begin{center}
  \captionof{table}{Mission space properties\label{tab:worlds}}
  \begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
    Name & Size & Obstacles\\
    \hline
    Tinyworld & 1.5-by-1.5 square & None\\
    Tinyworld2 & 1.5-by-1.5 square & Central 0.5-by-0.5 square\\
    Rectworld & 10-by-10 square & None\\
    Complexworld & Pentagon & Horizontal wall, vertical wall and hexagon
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
For all mission spaces simulations are performed where the dispersion term is neglected ($k_{1} = 0$), i.e.
$H(\mathbf{X}_{\mathcal{B}_{a}\cup\{a\}}) = L(\mathbf{X}_{\mathcal{B}_{a}\cup\{a\}})$, and where the dispersion term
is present ($k_{1} = 1$). In all simulations the initial configuration of the swarm is a zigzag patter starting in the bottom
left corner of the mission space moving upwards. Agents are numbered from top to bottom, meaning the top-most agent is agent $0$, and for 
a swarm of size $N$ the bottom-most agent is agent $N-1$. Thus the topmost agent will always be the first to optimize its position
when running Algorithm \ref{alg:alg1}.

Swarm configurations are plotted as follows: The boundary of visible set of an agent is plotted as a dashed line. All areas within the visible set 
of at least three agents is solid blue. Agents are visualized as orange dots.

In the step length plots, the step length trajectory of each agent is displayed as a uniquely coloured line. For simulations on large swarms
including legends would cause the figures to have to be unreasonably large. For consistency no step length plots include legends.
