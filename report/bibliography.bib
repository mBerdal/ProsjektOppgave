  abstract = {A unified combinatorial approach is used to obtain many theorems about Sn, the number of successes in n independent non-identical Bernoulli trials. The following results are, in particular, proved: (1) The variance of Sn increases as the set of success probabilities {pi} tends to be more and more homogeneous and attains its maximum as they become identical; (2) The density of Sn is unimodal: first increasing then decreasing; (3) Four different versions of Poisson's theorem; (4) An upper bound for the total variation between the distribution of Sn and that of the Poisson.},

  abstract = {This work proposes a new approach to determine the spatial location and orientation of an object using measurements performed on the object itself. The on-board triangulation algorithm we outline could be implemented in lieu of, or in addition to, well-known alternatives such as Global Positioning System (GPS) or standard triangulation, since both of these correspond to significantly different geometric pictures and necessitate different hardware and algorithms. We motivate the theory by describing situations in which on-board triangulation would be useful and even preferable to standard methods. The on-board triangulation algorithm we outline involves utilizing dumb beacons which broadcast omnidirectional single frequency radio waves, and smart antenna arrays on the object itself to infer the direction of the beacon signals, which may be used for onboard calculation of the position and orientation of the object. Numerical examples demonstrate the utility of the method and its noise tolerance.},

It is necessary to have a good and efficient cluster formation and cluster head selection algorithm to connect with other neighbouring node. Their communication should do in very less time. The various techniques are available to make cluster. Battery life, speed, packet delivery ratio, delay these are some important parameter through which we can make efficient algorithm. This survey paper focuses on the Comparison between Lowest ID (LID), Highest Degree (HD), LEACH(Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy).}

  abstract = {The recent advances in radio and em beddedsystem technologies have enabled the proliferation of wireless microsensor networks. Such wirelessly connected sensors are released in many diverse environments to perform various monitoring tasks. In many such tasks, location awareness is inherently one of the most essential system parameters. It is not only needed to report the origins of events, but also to assist group querying of sensors, routing, and to answer questions on the network coverage. In this paper we present a novel approach to the localization of sensors in an ad-hoc network. We describe a system called AHLoS (Ad-Hoc Localization System) that enables sensor nodes to discover their locations using a set distributed iterative algorithms. The operation of AHLoS is demonstrated with an accuracy of a few centimeters using our prototype testbed while scalability and performance are studied through simulation.},

  abstract = {The utility of micro air vehicles (MAVs) has expanded significantly in the last decade, and there are now numerous commercial systems available at relatively low cost. This expansion has arisen mainly due to the miniaturisation of flight control systems and advances in energy storage and propulsion technologies. Several emerging applications involve routine operation of MAVs in complex urban environments such as parcel delivery, communications relay and environmental monitoring. However, MAVs currently rely on one or more operators-in-the-loop and, whilst desirable, full autonomous operation has not yet been achieved. In this review paper, autonomous MAV operation in complex environments is explored with conceptualisation for future MAV operation in urban environments. Limitations of current technologies are systematically examined through consideration of the state-of-the-art and future trends. The main limitations challenging the realisation of fully autonomous MAVs are mainly attributed to: computational power, communication and energy storage. These limitations lead to poor sensing and planning capabilities, which are essential components of autonomous MAVs. Possible solutions are explored with goal of enabling MAVs to reliably operate autonomously in urban environments.}

  abstract = {The use of mobile robots in search-and-rescue and disaster-response missions has increased significantly in recent years. However, they are still remotely controlled by expert professionals on an actuator set-point level, and they would benefit, therefore, from any bit of autonomy added. This would allow them to execute high-level commands, such as “execute this trajectory” or “map this area.” In this paper, we describe a vision-based quadrotor micro aerial vehicle that can autonomously execute a given trajectory and provide a live, dense three-dimensional (3D) map of an area. This map is presented to the operator while the quadrotor is mapping, so that there are no unnecessary delays in the mission. Our system does not rely on any external positioning system (e.g., GPS or motion capture systems) as sensing, computation, and control are performed fully onboard a smartphone processor. Since we use standard, off-the-shelf components from the hobbyist and smartphone markets, the total cost of our system is very low. Due to its low weight (below 450 g), it is also passively safe and can be deployed close to humans. We describe both the hardware and the software architecture of our system. We detail our visual odometry pipeline, the state estimation and control, and our live dense 3D mapping, with an overview of how all the modules work and how they have been integrated into the final system. We report the results of our experiments both indoors and outdoors. Our quadrotor was demonstrated over 100 times at multiple trade fairs, at public events, and to rescue professionals. We discuss the practical challenges and lessons learned. Code, datasets, and videos are publicly available to the robotics community.},
