  abstract = {A unified combinatorial approach is used to obtain many theorems about Sn, the number of successes in n independent non-identical Bernoulli trials. The following results are, in particular, proved: (1) The variance of Sn increases as the set of success probabilities {pi} tends to be more and more homogeneous and attains its maximum as they become identical; (2) The density of Sn is unimodal: first increasing then decreasing; (3) Four different versions of Poisson's theorem; (4) An upper bound for the total variation between the distribution of Sn and that of the Poisson.},

  abstract = {This work proposes a new approach to determine the spatial location and orientation of an object using measurements performed on the object itself. The on-board triangulation algorithm we outline could be implemented in lieu of, or in addition to, well-known alternatives such as Global Positioning System (GPS) or standard triangulation, since both of these correspond to significantly different geometric pictures and necessitate different hardware and algorithms. We motivate the theory by describing situations in which on-board triangulation would be useful and even preferable to standard methods. The on-board triangulation algorithm we outline involves utilizing dumb beacons which broadcast omnidirectional single frequency radio waves, and smart antenna arrays on the object itself to infer the direction of the beacon signals, which may be used for onboard calculation of the position and orientation of the object. Numerical examples demonstrate the utility of the method and its noise tolerance.},
