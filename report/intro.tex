\section{Introduction}

A first responder (FR) is a person who is among those responsible for going immediately to the scene of an accident or emergency to provide assistance \cite{FR}.
They will typically be employed by the emergency services such as the police, fire department or health services, and take it upon themselves to secure the health of people, property and the enivornment.
Often times this includes sacrificing their own safety in order to secure that of others. The the need for quick action gives them no other choice.

Search-and-rescue personell in particular expose themselves to dangerous environments. Burning buildings, collapsed or flooded caves etc. are just some examples of the rapid-changing
hazardeous evironments in which FRs can find themselves. Often times they enter without any knowledge of what is waiting for them on the other side. Imagine a burning building. The local fire department has just arrived. There is no time to 
spare, so the first firefighters enter to save the lives of those inside before the floor plan is inspected. It might not even be valid as the roaring fire continues to eat up the walls and support beams for the roof. Still the firefighters enter in order to rescue those inside.
If something is to happen to the entering firefighters there is no way to locate them, and the ones entering to save them still don't know what is waiting for them inside.

Advancements in technology can be used to limit the dangers to which FRs expose themselves. With the increasing performance and decreasing cost of mobile robots, and the ability to outfit them with whatever equipment one might think of, it is relevant to think of how 
this might be used to the advantage of first responders. Using disposable robots for tasks such as mapping the environment could drastically improve the safety of FRs. In the example stated above, mobile robots could be dispatched into the burning house
and continuously feed the firedighters with a real time map of the environment. Robots could also enter the building to set up an ad-hoc network \cite{GAVHALE2016477} used for locating FRs inside GNSS denied environments, or supply information about events happening, such as changes in the environment or the
presence of poisenous gasses etc.

The challenge in creating such ad-hoc networks lay in enabling the robots to quickly set up the network as desired without supervision. This is the matter that will be studied in this report.
